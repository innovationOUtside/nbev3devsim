### About `ev3devsim`

`ev3devsim` is a "browser based simulator for ev3dev-lang-python" [[repo](https://github.com/QuirkyCort/ev3dev-sim), [demo](https://www.aposteriori.com.sg/Ev3devSim/index.html)]. The original demostration provides a browser based terminal for writing ev3dev-lang-pyhton code that is then executed in a Javascript based Skulpt Python environment and used to control a simulated robot via a simple 2D simulator implemented using Javascript and HTML canvas elements.
